# Deterministic Yahtzee!

Have you ever zero’d your Yahtzee only to roll one on the next turn? Take away that frustration with Deterministic Yahtzee, where the results of the dice rolls are all known ahead of time and you can choose a strategy that maximises your score.

* Save a lone one because you happen to know it’ll become a high straight!
* Put a full house in your three of a kind because you know you'll roll a 1,1,1,2,2 later on!
* Re-roll all five dice four times in a row because there's a rich seam of sixes you want to get to!

I just scored 640 points! Imagine doing that in normal Yahtzee! You’d have to be a psychic cheating time traveller!

Well [now you can be](https://github.andrewt.net/deterministic-yahtzee).
